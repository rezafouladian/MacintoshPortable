## Additions to the Powerbook 100 ROM

The Powerbook 100 ROM is identical to the ROM used in the Macintosh Portable M5120 and M5126, with the addition of code for booting in SCSI Target Disk Mode.

## Differences on the M5126 Macintosh Portable

- Backlit display, with additional ICs on the logic board to support this
- Simplified power circuitry (no hybrid)
- Removed the external power manager connector and switch
- Removed ROM wait state select switch
- Replaced the 32 SRAM chips with 8 PSRAM chips
- Additional logic to generate a faster <span style="text-decoration:overline">DTACK</span> signal for the RAM as well as a refresh signal
- Minor changes to sound circuitry

## Other Early Portable Mac Clones

- M' TOP
- Outbound Laptop

## Does the Portable supply SCSI termination power on the external connector?
No, similar to the Macintosh Plus, the Macintosh Portable does not supply termination power to the external DB-25 SCSI connector.
