# Temporary Home Page

TODO: Nice image of the Macintosh Portable here.

This site is still a work in progress, so many things are incomplete or in the wrong place.

## Tips for using the site

There are navigation menus on the left and right. Use the menu on the left to navigate to a specific page, and the links on the right to jump around on longer pages.  

On smaller browser windows or mobile the navigation menus may be moved into the "hamburger" :material-menu: menu in the top right.

Search is also available.

You can click on image thumbnails to view larger versions.
