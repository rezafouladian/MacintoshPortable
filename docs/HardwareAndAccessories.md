## Video Adapters

### Apple Macintosh Portable Video Adapter (Cancelled)

![](media/topanga.jpg){ width="15%" }

The codename for this adapter or video output capability on the Portable appears to have been "Topanga".

### Computer Care VideoMacPac
The VideoMacPac was a video card that went in the PDS slot and allowed a second screen, unlike the regular video output on the Portable that mirrored the internal display.

It appears to be heavily based off the Lapis DisplayServer based on the code.

Also see the clone of this card, [VideoMacPacHack](https://github.com/apmcpherson/VideoMacPacHack/).
