# Outbound Hard Drive

The Outbound 125 supported either an internal floppy drive or an internal hard drive. You could only have one or the other, and the EEPROM only included code for one at a time.

These appear to have been PrarieTek 2.5" hard drives.

The hard drive version of the EEPROM included a driver called `.PTek` to add support for the drive to the system.
