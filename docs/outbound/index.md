# Outbound

This is the Outbound section of the site for the portable Macintosh clone from Outbound Systems, Inc.

It is typically known as the Outbound Laptop, Outbound 125, or Outbound Wallaby.

While the Outbound 125 uses Macintosh Plus or Macintosh SE ROMs, it came out around the same time as the Portable and shares some of the pre-Powerbook design ideas. There also is not much documentation on it online.
