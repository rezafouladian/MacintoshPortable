# Outbound Keyboard

The Outbound Laptop features a detachable wireless keyboard and trackbar that uses infrared to communicate.

The microprocessor in the keyboard is a MC68HC705C8.

## Keyboard Battery

The original battery appears to have been a Sanyo CR12600SE 3V lithium battery, but since those are uncommon you can use two "N" size 1.5V alkaline batteries instead.

## Keyboard Cable

The keyboard can be connected with a cable instead of using infrared wireless.

The cable seems to be a standard RJ-11 4P4C cable with a straight 1:1 pinout.
